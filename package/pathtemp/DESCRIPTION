Description:  The normalizing constant plays an important role in Bayesian computation. Adaptive path sampling
    iteratively reduces the gap between the proposal and the target density, and provide a reliable 
    normalizing constant  estimation with practical diagnostic using importance sampling theory. When 
    equip simulated tempering with a continuous temperature, path tempering enables efficient sampling 
    from multimodal densities.
